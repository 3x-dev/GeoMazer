# Java-Game-Project-GeoMazer
## A game I made called GeoMazer for my school's Java class.

This is a maze game to help students learn and reinforce their concepts on USA/World Geography while having fun.

Download the GeoMazer5.java file and the 2 folders (pictures & questions) into the same directory.
Compile and run the GeoMazer5.java file to play.

Compile and run using the following commands in your terminal window:
**Compile:**
javac GeoMazer5.java

**Run:**
java GeoMazer5

Have fun!
