# Java-Game-Project
A game project for my school's Java class.

This is a maze game to help students learn and reinforce their concepts on USA/World Geography while having fun.

Download the GeoMazer5.java file and the 2 folders (pictures & questions) into the same directory.
Run the GeoMazer5.java file to play.

Have fun!
